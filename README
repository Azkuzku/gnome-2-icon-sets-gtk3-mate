Most of this was built off of the work of

and the original authors of the Gnome 2 icon set and gperfection2 for that matter.

What I did here was merely fix some issues like the "show desktop" button
missing a LOWDPI variant, and the SmokeyBlue theme using the incorrect icon
sizes for stuff like the home folder. There may be oversights still left
somewhere, but I'd consider this more than usable for daily computing.

I also added some new relative links for modern programs (discord, firefox-esr,
etc), added a period-correct Steam logo and modified Audacity's old logo for it
to fit in better with the rest of the package.
Nobody likes it when icons stick out from a theme.
