Most of this was built off of the work of eqlovelace
https://www.deviantart.com/eqlovelace/art/Old-GNOME2-Icon-Theme-192943815

and the original authors of the Gnome 2 icon set and gperfection2 for that matter.

The idea of this project is to fix and add onto the already existing porting
projects of the old Gnome 2 icon themes. I'm mainly focused on adding icons for
new programs and fixing incompatibilities and graphical issues.

I personally recommend using MenuLibre to fix any missing icons (gnome-disks > disks, etc)

<h1>INSTALLATION</h1>
Just run the install.sh script, it should automatically copy them over to your ~/.icons/
folder. Alternatively you can just copy the files into /usr/share/icons/ for systemwide
access. Please note that SmokeyRed and Crux are dependent on the SmokeyBlue theme, and
won't function properly without it.
