Most of this was built off of the work of eqlovelace

and the original authors of the Gnome 2 icon set and gperfection2 for that matter.

The idea of this project is to fix and add onto the already existing porting
projects of the old Gnome 2 icon themes. I'm mainly focused on adding icons for
new programs and fixing incompatibilities and graphical issues.

I personally recommend using MenuLibre to fix any missing icons (gnome-disks > disks, etc)
